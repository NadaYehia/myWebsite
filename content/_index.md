              Responsibilities include:

              * I developed a computational model for spatial navigation that mimics real animal behavior and their fast learning dynamics.
              * My model integrates goal learning with motion planning and execution using a Bayesian inference framework, outperforming existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms that solve the same problem.
              * I drove research from theoretical conception to practical implementation resulting in a software package to simulate agents' learning to intercept hidden rewards given any environment setup.

              Responsibilities include:
              * I implemented an Echo State Network model (ESN) for electromyography (EMG) hand gestures classification.
              * The model serves as a benchmark for Recurrent Neural Networks (especially Echo State Networks) performance to
                classify real EMG data from amputees using the NinaPro public dataset.

              Responsibilities include:
              * I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used in automated in-store inventory management.
              * I trained a CNN model to recognize and segment our customers’ products from mobile phone cameras' shelf images.
              * My model succeeded to extract the target images, along with history data in the same store it computed sales metrics 
                to help business owners maximize their profits.

              Responsibilities include:
              * Developed an image analysis pipeline using computer vision algorithms to segment and classify blood vessles into arteries or veins and extract other geometrical features in scleral images taken by mobile cameras.
              * I designed a prototype for the medical device that is used to acquire the scleral images, as well I was responsible for acquiring our dataset in healthy and patients subjects.
              * This pipeline was used as a preliminary prototype to assess cardiovascular risk in individuals with poor access to medical care facilities.
              * I found that some features in the eye vasculature, e.g arteriolar to venular diameter ratios, are good predictors for elevated cardiovascualr risk.
              * This work was the first to quanitfy the utility of using scleral images in predicting cardiovascular risk and other conditions like Preeclampsia,                  a complication that can happen in some pregnancies.

       Animals quickly learn to navigate to rewarding or salient landmarks in their environments. However, existing models often require thousands of trials to learn contingencies that animals learn within tens of trials, and they do so via unstructured sequences of actions that do not mimic real behavior. In this work, we study rapid learning in a hidden-target foraging task for mice in which animals learn to intercept an uncued target location within an open arena. In this work we integrate concepts that have typically been treated separately—such as motor planning, execution, and spatial learning—to understand how animals efficiently explore space and quickly modify their behavior based on experience. Our model succeeds in replicating animals fast learning dynamics (learning to intercept hidden targets in tens of trials) and mimics their naturalistic trajectories.
