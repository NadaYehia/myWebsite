I am a postdoctoral scientist in computational neuroscience at the Dudman and Hermundstad labs in Janelia research campus. As a Postdoctoral Associate at Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), I conduct cutting-edge research in neuroscience, applying programming and theortical modeling skills to explain animals' behavioral data and model their underlying computational logic. I have over five years of work experience in the fields of computational neuroscience, medical informatics and image processing, and machine learning, having worked as a PhD graduate at The University of Sheffield, a Machine Learning Engineer at AUC Venture Lab and a Masters graduate in the medical informatics group at Nile University. I have developed and implemented innovative solutions for various challenges, such as creating a deep learning framework for retail analytics, building an image processing and machine learning pipeline to screen for cardiovascular risk using eye images, and modeling learning and plasticity rules in rate firing neural networks. My core competencies include programming, algorithms, computer vision, data analysis, and problem-solving. I am passionate about advancing the scientific understanding of the brain and its functions, and contributing to the development of new technologies and applications that can improve human health and well-being. I value collaboration, creativity, and curiosity, and seek to join a team that shares these values and supports my professional growth.
