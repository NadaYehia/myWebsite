I am a Postdoctoral Associate in Computational Neuroscience at Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Janelia Research Campus, where I work in the Dudman and Hermundstad labs to bridge theoretical models with behavioral data. My research deciphers the computational logic underlying animal behavior, combining advanced programming, machine learning, and mathematical modeling.
*With 5+ years of interdisciplinary experience across computational neuroscience, medical AI, and machine learning, I’ve developed innovative solutions such as:*

A deep learning framework for retail analytics (AUC Venture Lab)

An AI pipeline for cardiovascular risk screening from retinal images (Nile University)

Biologically plausible learning rules for spiking neural networks (University of Sheffield)

My technical expertise spans algorithms, computer vision, and large-scale data analysis, but I’m driven by a deeper mission: advancing brain science to improve human health. I thrive in collaborative environments that value curiosity, creativity, and translational impact—and I’m eager to contribute these perspectives to teams tackling bold challenges in neurotechnology and AI
